# SentenceGraph

These scripts allows you to manage the sentences parsed by syntax parser in CoNNLU-2014 format. See **Guide.ipynb** for details.


Here the UDpipe syntax parser is provided(don't forget that no one syntax parser has 100% accuracy). Here the only Russian model is available due to space limitations, but actually, for other languages, English in particular, you can find the model [here](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2998) or train you own model. How to do this, see [here](https://astromis.github.io/2019/05/15/discover_the_udpipe.html)
