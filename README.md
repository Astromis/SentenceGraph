# SentenceGraph

These scripts allows you to manage the sentences parsed by syntax parser in CoNNLU-2014 format. See **Guide.ipynb** for details.

In order to be able to plot graphs you need to install next packages:
```
$ sudo apt install python-pydot python-pydot-ng graphviz
```

Here the UDpipe syntax parser is provided. Here the only Russian model is available due to space limitations, but actually, for other languages, English in particular, you can find the model [here](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2998) or train you own model. How to do this, see [here](https://astromis.github.io/2019/05/15/discover_the_udpipe.html)
